Just an idea...

When I look at the series file for Unionfs, I see 3 distinct sections:

1) patches already pushed to kernel.org
2) patches pending push to kernel.org
3) patches currently being developed

On a number of occasions, I want to quickly push/pop to a certain boundry
between the 3 categories. (Suppose, I am about to push things to kernel.org
- I want to have all the patches in #1 and #2 pushed onto the stack, but
none of #3.) One way would be to specify some kind of tag in the series file
to indicate where one category ends and another starts.

Here's an idea about how to annotate the series file to know about such
logical breaks via a mechanism I call "tags".

Things to keep in mind:

1) The series file should work in quilt without modifications
2) The tags should be easily visible
3) The tags should not be painful to look at
4) The code necessary to process the tags should not be very complex
5) Arbitrary number of tags should be allowed
6) Multiple tags should be allowed for any one part of series file (in other
   words, any number of tags can be placed between the same two patches, and
   using one one of the tags will yield the same result)
7) push/pull should check whether patchname supplied is a tag, if it is
   translate it to the appropriate patchname
8) series/applied/unapplied/top should allow the user to see the tag names
   placed within the outpu (with the right option (-t ?)) 

For example, the following format satisfies all of the items above:

#@tagname

where tagname = [^/\0\n\r\w]+
