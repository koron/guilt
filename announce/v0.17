Horst H. von Brand (2):
      Fix up Makefiles
      Run regression on the current version

Josef 'Jeff' Sipek (24):
      A minimalistic makefile
      Contributing doc file
      Added guilt-add
      Added guilt-status
      Expanded the HOWTO
      Added usage strings to all commands
      All arguments to guilt-add are filenames
      More thorough argument checking & display usage string on failure
      Changed status file format to include the hash of the commit
      Fixed guilt-refresh doing an unnecessary and somewhat wrong pop&push
      Fixed up guilt-{delete,pop} not matching the patch name properly
      Fixed guilt-{delete,pop} regexps some more
      Force UTC as timezone for regression tests
      Fixed a bug in guilt-pop introduced by the status file format switch
      Error messages should go to stderr
      Merge branch 'usage'
      Merge branch 'status-file'
      Yet another TODO update
      Added guilt-rm
      Makefile update & cleanup
      pop: Display the name of the patch from the status file, not the series file
      new: Create dir structure for the patch if necessary
      Documentation/TODO: Mark guilt-rm as done
      Guilt v0.17
