Guilt v0.27 is available for download (once it mirrors out on kernel.org).

Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.

Alright, I'm trying to get back to the 2-week release schedule, so here's
v0.27!

There has been a number of changes in those two weeks, Out of the 20
commits, about half of them are bug fixes of all sorts - mostly preventive
(does anyone actually use whitespace in their branch names?).

The major changes include some performance speedups. Little bit thought
(there's more to come!) went into making guilt-push faster, 0.27 is about 8%
faster than 0.26 on push. The other major thing is the infrastructure (which
turned out to be really simple) for hooks. Currently, only one hook is
supported (guilt-delete) but that'll change sooner or later.

And the last major change under the hood: guilt now checks and expects git
1.5.

Other new features:
	guilt-series -e	to edit the series file by hand
	guilt-header -e to edit a patch's header
	guilt-refresh --diffstat to include a diffstat in the patch file

As always, patches, and other feedback is welcome.

Josef "Jeff" Sipek.
