Josef 'Jeff' Sipek (10):
      push_patch should be more careful when applying patches
      pop_patch should be quieter
      Removed debug line out of push_patch
      guilt-pop is now less brain damaged
      Add -m & -s args to guilt-new
      push_patch: look at diff stats instead of number of lines in patch
      Check HEAD hash against what we expect before push/pop/refresh
      Small cleanup in push_patch
      TODO moved to a separate branch
      Guilt v0.18
