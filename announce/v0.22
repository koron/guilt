Guilt v0.22 is available for download (once it mirrors out on kernel.org).

Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.

Git repo:

The changes to Guilt could be divided into three categories:

1) Documentation: Quite a bit of documentation was added.

2) Bugfixes:
    - guilt-patchbomb did not actually do the right action based on user's
      answer to the question about removal of the temporary patch directory.

    - Many places in the code used variables in an unsafe way - a whitespace
      in a path could have caused very bad things to happen.

    - Guilt 0.21 did not allow the user to be in a subdirectory and run
      guilt commands.

    - guilt-files did not recurse into subdirectories.

3) Features: Autotagging:

    Automatically creates unannotated tags for top, bottom, and base of the
    stack

    On every push or pop operation (refresh is a pop followed by a push),
    update the stack top (${branch}_top), stack bottom (${branch}_bottom),
    and stack base (${branch}_base) tags.

    Top:	Topmost applied patch/commit
    Bottom:	Bottommost applied patch/commit
    Base:	Commit on top of which the bottom most patch is applied

    Having these three tags, one can easily get the log/diff/other information
    only for commits that are (or are not!) part of the patch stack.

    Autotagging can be disabled by setting guilt.autotag=0 in your git
    config file.

    Additionally, guilt-init now accepts a new parameter '-n' to
    automatically set guilt.autotag=0 in the current repository.


As always, patches, and other feedback is welcome.

Josef "Jeff" Sipek.
