Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Guilt v0.31

Guilt v0.31 is available for download.

Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.

Tarballs:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jsipek/guilt/

Git repo:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jsipek/guilt.git


This is a mostly bugfixes-only release to get the fixes that accumulated
over the past several months out of the door.

As always, patches, and other feedback is welcome.

Josef "Jeff" Sipek.
