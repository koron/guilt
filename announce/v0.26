Guilt v0.26 is available for download (once it mirrors out on kernel.org).

Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.

Although there was a v0.26-rc1 release, I never announced it so the
following summary includes all the changes since v0.25. Unfortunately, it
took two months to get this release out. I promise to get back to the 2-3
week release cycle.

The major change since v0.25 (contributed by Pierre Habouzit) is that Guilt
no longer depends on bash. Other than that, there have been a number of bug
fixes, as well several new commands and options:

	branch		Branch the repository & patch series
	diff		Output a diff against the top-most applied patch
	fold -k		Keep patch file
	graph		Generate dot(1) patch dependecy graph
	new -f		Force new patch creation
	refresh --git	Detect renames & copies
	series -g	Start gitk on the applied patches

Additionally, Guilt now knows how to:

	Grab Cc: lines from the patch descriptions for patchbomb
	Strip 'Subject: ' from the first line of patch description

All in all, quite a number of changes, so it is possible that I forgot to
mention something. For more details, check the change list below, or the git
repository near you :)

As always, patches, and other feedback is welcome.
