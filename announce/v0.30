Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Guilt v0.30

Guilt v0.30 is available for download (once it mirrors out on kernel.org).

Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.

As promissed, this version includes some interesting changes.  The major one
being the status file now has a new format.  The motivation for this was the
fact that the series file effectively duplicated functionality that git
itself offered by setting arbitrary refs (e.g., refs/patches/$branch/$patch).
Migration between the two formats should be rather painless.  If you have no
applied patches, no extra work is required.  If you happen to have some
patches already applied, any guilt command will tell you to run:
guilt-repair --status.

Other than the status file change, there have been a number of improvements
all over the place.  A couple of bash-isms were removed, patchbomb no longer
includes "1/1" in the subject when there's only one patch, guilt-repair is
more powerful, and can be used to fix up a number of conditions (e.g.,
autotags left behind, status file format upgrade, etc.), autotagging no
longer ignores global guilt.autotag config value.

As always, patches, and other feedback is welcome.

Josef "Jeff" Sipek.
