Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Guilt v0.29

Guilt v0.29 is available for download (once it mirrors out on kernel.org).

Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.

Tarballs:

Git repo:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jsipek/guilt.git


This release is quite uneventful.  It is made up of a few fixes here and
there, and complete regression suite rewrite.  Unfortunately, most of the
exciting Guilt development went on in a topic branch, but the changes are
far too invasive for me to include them in v0.29, so I'm going to merge that
in for v0.30.

As always, patches, and other feedback is welcome.

Josef "Jeff" Sipek.
