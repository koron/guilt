Guilt v0.25 is available for download (once it mirrors out on kernel.org).

Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.

Really the only major changes are the new commands: import and rebase.

guilt-import allows one to import a patch into the Guilt series easily

guilt-rebase is very similar to git-rebase - it detects patches that were
pushed upstream. NOTE: This command is still not perfect, so use it with
caution.

As always, patches, and other feedback is welcome.
