Guilt v0.28 is available for download (once it mirrors out on kernel.org).

Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.

(kernel.org seems to be slow at mirroring things today, so please be
patient)

This release took _far_ too long to make. The major changes since v0.27
include:

 - fix for insecure handling of temporary files (CVE-2007-5207)
 - push and pop now support -n <num> to push/pop specified number of patches
 - import-commit can import any commit from any branch
 - couple of other small bugfixes/tweaks

For more details about any of the commits, check the commits.

As always, patches, and other feedback is welcome.

Josef "Jeff" Sipek.
