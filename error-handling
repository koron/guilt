Currently, if a guilt operation is killed by the user mid-way through, it is
possible that temporary files are left over. For example, the guilt-graph
command creates a filename hash cache in .git/patches/$branch/.graphcache.$$.
If guilt-graph is killed before it deletes the cache, the cache consisting
of potentially many files is left on the filesystem.

Another command which creates a temporary cache is the guilt-rebase command.

Bash provides a way to set hooks which get executed when certain signals are
received, guilt should use these hooks whenever possible to run cleanup code
as necessary.
