The current rebase command assumes all patches will either apply, or will
not have to be applied (in other words, they were included upstream). One
problem that a user rebasing a set of patches might come across, is the fact
that sometimes, a patch needs to be applied, however it does not apply
cleanly - and therefore, it should be fixed up.

Guilt should follow the lead of git, and allow the user to take one of the
following actions when a patch which does not apply cleanly is encountered,
and the user is dropped into a shell:

	--continue :: the code has been fixed up, continue rebasing
	--skip :: skip the current patch, continue rebasing
	--abort :: abort rebasing, restore repository state to what it was
			 before rebasing began
