NAME
----
guilt-patchbomb - Email a series of commits interactively

SYNOPSIS
--------
include::usage-guilt-patchbomb.txt[]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Send a series of commits via email asking for To, CC and other information
interactively.

OPTIONS
-------
-n::
	Don't send

-s::
	Don't add additional repository committer sign-offs to the patch.
	This allows the sign-off chain to be fully expressed in the commit
	messages and not changed by the act of sending a patchbomb.

--in-reply-to <msgid>::
	Set the In-reply-to header to the specified message id. This allows
	the patches to be sent as replies to an arbitrary message.

--git::
	Generate a patch which uses all the features offered by the git diff
	format (e.g., rename and copy detection).

--subject-prefix <prefix>::
	Rather than using the standard [PATCH] prefix in the subject line,
	use [<prefix>] instead.
