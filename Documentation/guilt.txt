NAME
----
guilt - quilt on top of git

SYNOPSIS
--------
'guilt' COMMAND [ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Andrew Morton originally developed a set of scripts for maintaining kernel
patches outside of any SCM tool. Others extended these into a suite called
quilt. The basic idea behind quilt is to maintain patches instead of
maintaining source files. Patches can be added, removed or reordered, and
they can be refreshed as you fix bugs or update to a new base revision.
quilt is very powerful, but it is not integrated with the underlying SCM
tools. This makes it difficult to visualize your changes.

Guilt allows one to use quilt functionality on top of a Git repository.
Changes are maintained as patches which are committed into Git.  Commits can
be removed or reordered, and the underlying patch can be refreshed based on
changes made in the working directory. The patch directory can also be
placed under revision control, so you can have a separate history of changes
made to your patches.

PATCHES DIRECTORY
-----------------

In Guilt, all the patches are stored in .git/patches/$branch/, where $branch
is the name of the branch being worked on. This means that one can have a
independent series of patches for each branch present in the repository.
Each of these per-branch directories contains 3 special files:

guards: This file contains any guards that should be applied to the
series when pushing. It is only present when guards are selected.

series: This file contains a list of all the patch filenames relative to the
per-branch patch directory. Empty and commented out lines are ignored.

status: This file contains the state of the stack. What patches are applied.

HOOKS
-----
Any guilt operation may execute zero or more hook scripts which can be used
to run any housekeeping commands or even abort the execution of the command.
