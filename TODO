Commands:
=========

Misc Bugs/Enhancements:
=======================

Here are some things I want to do one of these days...

- Fix push/pop regression tests to cover --all/multi-patch cases

- Add more regression tests

- Fix path munging in push_patch

- Make guilt-* work from any dir ( => make regression tests to check that)

- Make sh a requirement, not bash

- Make things as portable as git

- Manual pages

- Make sure whitespace in patch names doesn't break anything ( => make
  regression tests)

- Make guilt-help more intelligent about where it looks for man pages (maybe
  try adding `dirname $0`/../man/ to the MANPATH inside guilt-help?)
