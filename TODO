Misc Bugs/Enhancements:
=======================

Here are some things I want to do one of these days...

- Fix push/pop regression tests to cover --all/multi-patch cases
- Add more regression tests
- guilt-delete should allow the user to delete the patch file as well
- Fix path munging in push_patch
- Make guilt-* work from any dir
- guilt-push should output info if there is an offset
- Make sh a requirement, not bash
- Make things as portable as git
