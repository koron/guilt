Misc Bugs/Enhancements:
=======================

Here are some things I want to do one of these days...

- Fix push/pop regression tests to cover --all/multi-patch cases

- Add more regression tests

- Fix path munging in push_patch

- Make guilt-* work from any dir

- guilt-push should output info if there is an offset

- Make sh a requirement, not bash

- Make things as portable as git

- import-commit/patchbomb should understand revision ranges
